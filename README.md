# Project 1 - Classification
- This project is designed used to try to predict who has diabetes and who does not given biological information.
- The data used in the project comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishkumarjayswal/diabetes-dataset?resource=download).
- This project includes some data exploration using seaborn, matplotlib, pandas and numpy.
- Then I use scikit-learn classification model and metrics to train and predict some test data and evaluate the model.

# Project 2 - Regression 
- This project attempts to find a model which can accurately predict the price of medical insurance.
- The data used in the project comes from a [raw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stedy/Machine-Learning-with-R-datasets/master/insurance.csv) data source.
- This project includes some data exploration using seaborn, matplotlib, pandas and numpy to find possible correlations between prices and six different characteristics of a person.
- Then using scikit-learn a linear regression model is used to try and predict the prices.
